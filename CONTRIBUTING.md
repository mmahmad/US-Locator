The Flask application is based on Python 3.7, but is running on a Python 3.6 AWS EBS environment.

Clone the repository, set up Python3.7, a virtual environment, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python3 packages in the virtual environment.

Do <b>NOT</b> change the file name of `application.py`, nor the variable `application` inside it. EBS relies on that to run properly. Other than that, feel free to modify.
